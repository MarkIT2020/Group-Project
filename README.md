# Feel free to change any files
In file "1. Data cleaning", I cleaned up the original data. This file creates 2 new csv files, "cardio.csv" and "test.csv". "test.csv" only contains 500 data points, so that jupyter notebook will run faster. P.S. file "cardio_train" is the original file.

In file "2. Numeric analysis", I created a heatmap for the correlation between all variables. Then, I focuses more on the numeric aspect of the data.

In file "3. Categorical analysis"ï¼Œ I looked at the relationships between the variable cardio and the rest of the categorical data. 

In file "4. Logistic regression", I tried to predict the logistic regression model and neural network model to predict variable cardio, and the accuracy is around 72%. (Thank NEW BING)

In file "5. Neural Network", I used neural network to predict cardio. The prediction accuracy is around 73%. It seems that 1 layer of 100 neuron is the best option.

Ignore file "6. Decision tree". It's for testing

In file "7. Clustering and anomaly", I'm not too sure if this file will be useful, but I though I might just write it
