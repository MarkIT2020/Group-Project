# Feel free to change any files
In file "1. Data cleaning", I cleaned up the original data. This file creates 2 new csv files, "cardio.csv" and "test.csv". "test.csv" only contains 500 data points, so that jupyter notebook will run faster. 

In file "2. Numeric analysis", I created a heatmap for the correlation between all variables. Then, I focuses more on the numeric aspect of the data.

In file "3. Categorical analysis"ï¼Œ I looked at the relationships between the variable cardio and the rest of the categorical data. 

In file "4. Logistic regression neural network", I tried to predict the logistic regression model and neural network model to predict variable cardio, and the accuracy for both models are around 72%. (Thank NEW BING)

Ignore file "5. Decision tree". It's for testing

In file "6. Clustering and anomaly", I'm not too sure if this file will be useful, but I though I might just write it
